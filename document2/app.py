# App description and instructions

This application allows you to upload a document image and ask questions about its content. 
It uses a pre-trained NLP model to analyze the document and provide answers based on the text within the image.

### Instructions:
1. **Upload a Document**: Click on the "Upload a document image" button to select and upload an image file (PNG, JPG, or JPEG) of the document you want to query.
2. **Enter Your Question**: Type your question in the text input field.
3. **Get Results**: Once both the document and the question are provided, the model will process the document and display the answer.

**Note**: Ensure that the document is clear and legible for accurate results.
